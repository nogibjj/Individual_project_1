## Individual Project 1: Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions with RUFF linter

## Summary
---
This is indivudual project for IDS706 Data Engineering. In the project, we created a python script, along with a jupyter notebook script to produce some descriptive statistics for a [dataset](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/seankross/a412dfbd88b3db70b74b/raw/5f23f993cd87c283ce766e7ac6b329ee7cc2e1d1/mtcars.csv). The goal is to achieve automatic continous integration on Github including instaling, linting, testing and formating.

1. First thing to do on launch is to open a new shell and verify virtualenv is sourced.

Things included are:

* `Makefile`

* `Pytest`

* `pandas`

* `Ruff`:  

Run `make lint` which runs `ruff check`.  You can find out more info on [Ruff here](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

* `Dockerfile`

* `GitHub copilot`

* `jupyter` and `ipython` 

* A base set of libraries for devops and web

* `githubactions`
